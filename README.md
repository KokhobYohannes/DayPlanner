# DayPlanner
# Homeworkfive

Objective: 
Create a day planner with which a user could save their daily tasks. 

Goal:
Once the page loads, the user is presented with the current date, a brief description of the planner and color coded time blocks from 9 am - 5 pm.

If the user views the planner between 9 am - 5 pm, the current hour will be highlighted in a pink-ish red color. If the user still has time left in the day, the hours left will be highlighted in green. If the time has passed, the highlighted hours will be color coded in a grey color.

Once the user has finished entering their tasks for the day, they can click save. When they reload the page, the tasks will continue to be visible and can be repeatedly accessed.

Acknowlegements:
1) Tutors: I scheduled time with my BCS tutor, Queen Shabazz to troubleshoot issues with saving to local storage. I also scheduled additional time with a separate tutor to troubleshoot another issue with retrieving user data from local storage. They were immensely helpful in pointing me in the right direction and explaining steps I needed to take to correct my code.

2) Stack Overflow: I used a resource from Stack Overflow to color code the time blocks based on whether the time had passed, the current time (if between 9 am - 5 pm) and if there was time remaining in the work day (until 5 pm).https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62904905/how-do-i-color-code-time-blocks-using-js

3) Google Fonts: I used the following font families: Gilda Display; Poppins, sans-serif; Roboto, sans-serif; 'Noto Serif', serif;

4) Bootstrap: I used some starter code from Bootstrap and modified the layout as needed.

5) Font Awesome: Used to display the "save" icon.

6) Moment.js: Used to display the current date.
